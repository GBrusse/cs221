README

This program was written in java by the Boise State University Computer Science department and
completed by Gary Brusse.

This project revolves around using and manipulating Double Linked Lists.
When the run configurator is made to run UIDoubleLinkedList.java, the tests will automatically run.
The tests will test the programs ability to add and remove elements within the list, as well as add and
remove them from specified places within the list. In addition, the tests test how the program handles in-valid
inputs. Also tested, is the ability to get elements from specified indexes, as well as set certain indexes to hold
given elements.
